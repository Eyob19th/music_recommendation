# music_recommendation This repository contains a web application that integrates with a music recommendation system
The field of music information retrieval presents a challenge due to the various ways audio can be represented, making it difficult to determine which features should be prioritised in queries. To simplify this issue, our implementation focuses specifically on the rhythm of songs as the sole query feature. While previous research has explored rhythm-based music querying, current methods suffer from inefficiency, as they necessitate querying the entire data structure to match song rhythms. To overcome this limitation, we propose the utilisation of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), a technique that efficiently identifies similar items within large datasets without requiring exhaustive searches.
